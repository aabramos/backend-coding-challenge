The original Unbabel-py Api is currently not compatible with Python 3.6, which is used by this project.
The solution was to make a fork from the original project:
https://github.com/aabramos/unbabel-py

That fork contains a slightly customized version of the Unbabel-py Api that works with Python 3.6.
That custom version is replicated under the /unbabel/ folder, exclusively for this challenge.
